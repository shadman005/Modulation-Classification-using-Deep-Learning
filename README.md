# Modulation-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
In the field of communication, modulation is the process of encoding information from a message signal into a carrier wave signal. The carrier wave is a high-frequency signal that is used to transmit the low-frequency message signal over long distances.
Modulation classification is the process of identifying the modulation type of areceived radio signal. It is an important task in wireless communication forseveral reasons:

● Spectrum management: Modulation classification can be used to identify the type of signal that is occupying a particular frequency band. This canthen be used to allocate the band to the most appropriate user.

● Adaptive modulation: It can be used to adapt the modulation type of a transmitter to the current channel conditions. This can improve theperformance of the communication system by reducing the effects of noiseand interference.

● Spectrum sensing: It can be used to identify the presence of unauthorized users in a spectrum band. This can then be used to take action to block or interfere with the unauthorized signal.

● Signal classification: It can be used to classify the type of signal that is being received. This can then be used to determine the source of the signal and the type of information that it is carrying.
